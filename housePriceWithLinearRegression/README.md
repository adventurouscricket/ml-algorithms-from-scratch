# Overall.

Linear regression is one of the fundamental techniques in statistics and machine learning used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It's a form of supervised learning where the goal is to predict the value of a continuous target variable based on the values of one or more input features. In this kernel, we will implemet Linear Regression to predict the house price.
My aim is to implement the Linear Regression algorithm from scratch. I also use the KNN model from the Scikit Learn and Tensorflow library to compare the accuracy of my model.
