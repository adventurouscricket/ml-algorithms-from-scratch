# Overall.

K-Means clustering is the most popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm. K-Means clustering is used to find intrinsic groups within the unlabelled dataset and draw inferences from them. In this kernel, I implement K-Means(++) clustering to find intrinsic groups within the dataset that display the same status_type behaviour. The status_type behaviour variable consists of posts of a different nature (video, photos, statuses and links).

I have referenced from this kernel(https://www.kaggle.com/code/prashant111/k-means-clustering-with-python/notebook) by PRASHANT BANERJEE. PRASHANT BANERJEE. With PRASHANT BANERJEE's kernel, he has directly used the K-Means model from the Scikit Learn library, but my aim is to implement the K-Means algorithm from scratch so I will use his kernel's outline and do it myself Implement the K-Means algorithm. I also use the K-Means model from the Scikit Learn library to compare the accuracy of my model.

# Adjust to run on your system.

Because I'm running this kernel on Google Colab and pushing it directly into GitHub. So if you want to run it locally or anywhere, you should download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishg21/facebook-live-eller-in-thailand-uci -ml-repo and make some adjustments at #Import dataset section to make it suitable for with path folder.
